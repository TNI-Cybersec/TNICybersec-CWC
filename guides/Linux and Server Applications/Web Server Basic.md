The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one web site (such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine. Virtual hosts can be "**IP-based**", meaning that you have a different IP address for every web site, or "**name-based**", meaning that you have multiple names running on each IP address, or "**port-based**", meaning that you have a different port/socket for every web site. The fact that they are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.
